# Python Projects
This folder contains some projects I have completed using Python. These projects are currently pretty simple, but I hope to develop my understanding and progress into more intense projects eventually. My goal with Python would be to eventually begin developing my understanding and mastery of big data. 





## Project 1 - Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an entry level Tic-Tac-Toe gane after following the Pierian Data Complete Python BootCamp. This project includes the usage of for loops, while loops, if then statements, simple boolean logic, and functions. 

## Project 2 - Black Jack 
This is an entry level Black Jack game following the Pierian Data Complete Python BootCamp.This project takes everything we learned before but adds object oriented programing to the mix. First Crack at OOP and I enjoyed it a bunch. I hope to use OOP whenever I get a chance in newer projects!
