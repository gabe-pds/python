# Python Projects
This folder contains some projects I have completed using Python. These projects are currently pretty simple, but I hope to develop my understanding and progress into more intense projects eventually. My goal with Python would be to eventually begin developing my understanding and mastery of big data. 

## Project 1 - Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an entry level Tic-Tac-Toe gane after following the Pierian Data Complete Python BootCamp. This project includes the usage of for loops, while loops, if then statements, simple boolean logic, and functions. 

## Project 2 - Black Jack 
This is an entry level Black Jack game following the Pierian Data Complete Python BootCamp.This project takes everything we learned before but adds object oriented programing to the mix. First Crack at OOP and I enjoyed it a bunch. I hope to use OOP whenever I get a chance in newer projects!  

## Project 3 - Website Sentiment Analysis
This is a medium level project that uses the webscraping module textblob and the NLP module textblob to perform sentitment analysis on certain online new sources. My goal for this project was to create a visual scatted plot which indicates the subjectivity and polartity of all the news sites on the main page of a news company. This project required basic understanging of HTML to find the text which would be analyzed. One of the limitations of this program is the fact that not all websites are formatted the same. This code works by going to the main site page, collecting all the links from that page, then looping through those links and going to the 'p' <div> which had the text. Some of the websites had the main text in different HTML locations like classes, but the majority could be found int he 'p' div so that what I focused on accessing.
