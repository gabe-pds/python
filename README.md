# Python Projects
This folder contains some projects I have completed using Python. These projects are currently pretty simple, but I hope to develop my understanding and progress into more intense projects eventually. My focus with Python would be to eventually begin developing my understanding and mastery of big data. 





## Project 1 - Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an entry level Tic-Tac-Toe project after following the Pierian Data Complete Python BootCamp. This project includes the usage of for loops, while loops, if then statements, simple boolean logic, and functions.
